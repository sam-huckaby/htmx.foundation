	In the dynamic world of web development, the HTMX Foundation, a bastion for promoting and defending hypermedia
	across the internet, faced a pivotal moment. The foundation, once a small collective of enthusiastic developers,
	had grown exponentially, mirroring the evolving complexity and reach of hypermedia. However, with this growth
	came challenges. The landscape of web development was shifting rapidly, with new technologies emerging and older
	ones falling out of favor. The foundation needed a visionary leader to navigate these turbulent waters and
	ensure the continued relevance and advancement of hypermedia technologies.
